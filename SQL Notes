  ## Notes
  
  ~~~SQL BASICS~~~
  ## SQL - Structured Query Language
  ## RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
  ## DDL - Data Definition Language - Create/Alter/Delete Objects
  ## DML - Data Manipulation Language - Insert, Update, Delete data
  ## DCL - Data Control Language - Control Access 
  ## Declarative Programming - code that describes the acheivement instead of every step
  ## TSQL (Transact-SQL) - transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables.
  
  ~~~SQL SERVER BASICS~~~
  
  ~~~DATABASE ADMINISTRATION~~~
  ## Clustered Index - Records are physically indexed within the table 
  ## Non-Clustered Index - logical orders do not match the physical state on the disk
  ## Three Layers of Data Abstraction - 
  ## A. View (user view) - What the user sees
  ## B. Logical - the way the information is stored oredered and link
  ## C. Physical - Physical storage : the disk or device and hardware
  
  ~~~SQL PROGRAMMING~~~
  ## SELECT - extracts data from a database.
  SELECT membership type FROM allmembers
  SELECT DISTINCT membership type FROM allmembers - only shows unique data from these columns
  ## UPDATE - updates data in a table
  UPDATE allmembers // SET column1 = membership type
  ## DELETE - deletes data from a table
  DELETE FROM allmembers // WHERE membershiptype = "12month"
  ## INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database.
  INSERT INTO allmembers // 
  ## CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database.
  ## ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database.
  ## ALTER TABLE - makes all changes to the talbes
  ## CREATE TABLE - creates a new table.
  ## FROM - select table
  ## WHERE - a clause used to filter data
  ## AND, NOR, NOT- conditions used with where to filter
  ## ORDER BY - used to sort 
  ## VALUES - When inserting, deleting, and updating, use this to add values
  ## ISNULL, ISNOTNULL - (does not mean number 0) - to check if there is no value present
  ## SELECT TOP - filter records by value or by percentage
  SELECT TOP 25 (or) SELECT TOP 10%
  ## MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, COUNT - same function as excel but just select column
  SELECT MIN membershiptype
  ## LIKE - used with where to find a similarity between records
  ## WILDCARD - used to find a certain similarity between records - used to substitute for another string
  ## IN - (multiple OR arguments) specify values 
  ## BETWEEN - specify a range of values
  ## JOIN - clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them
  ## (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
  ## LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
  ## RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
  ## FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
  ## UNION - combine two or more select statements into one return
  ## GROUP BY - used with aggregate functions to group rows that have similar values
  ## ANY - returns boolean result if any values meet criteria
  ## ALL - returns boolean result if all values meet criteria
  ## CREATE INDEX - creates seperate a duplicate list or index of values from one column
  ## CREATE UNIQUE INDEX - duplicates only unique values to the index
  ## DROP INDEX - removes the index from the table
  ## CONCAT - adds two strings together
  ## REPLACE - just like the find and replace function for microsoft office "find x, replace with y"
  
  ~~~USING THE WHERE ARGUMENTS~~~
  SUM/AVG/COUNT- SELECT SUM                  - shows a standard value as an answer, Count Used as CountIf for records while AVG and SUM are used to calculate values
                 FROM octoberusage
                 WHERE visits>25
  MIN/MAX - SELECT MAX(visits) AS MostVisits - must declare a variable, returns a value within that variable. Works by column
            FROM octberusage
  
  ~~~INDEXES~~~
  Used to make queries faster. Can be used to make something like a mailing or call list of unique names or values quickly.
  USAGE
     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_membername
     ON octoberusage(membername)
     
  ~~~ADVANCED QUERIES~~~
  1. A query that shows the number of orders by shipper?
  SELECT shippers.shippername                                     - select the column by name
  COUNT (Orders.OrdersID) AS Number of Rows                       - count the number of values and declare a variable for storage
  FROM Orders                                                     - select table by name
  LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = ShipperShippersID      - only count matching variables between orders and shipments
  GROUP BY ShipperName                                            - group the shippers by name on the list
  2. The number of customers in each country sorted high to low
  SELECT COUNT (customerid), country                              - select countif per country using this to receive all country values
  FROM customers                                                  - from the table
  GROUP BY country                                                - sort the results by country
  ORDER BY COUNT (CUSTOMER ID) DESC;                              - add all values to make list then order then high to low
  3. Number of distinct customer countries
  SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT visits)                                  - select only unique values per this column then only show me how many there are
  FROM octoberusage                                               - from the table
