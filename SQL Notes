  ## Notes
  
  ## SQL BASICS
  ## SQL - Structured Query Language
  ## RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
  ## DDL - Data Definition Language - Create/Alter/Delete Objects
  ## DML - Data Manipulation Language - Insert, Update, Delete data
  ## DCL - Data Control Language - Control Access 
  ## Declarative Programming - code that describes the acheivement instead of every step
  ## TSQL (Transact-SQL) - transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables.
  
  ## SQL SERVER BASICS
  
  ## DATABASE ADMINISTRATION
  ## Clustered Index - Records are physically indexed within the table 
  ## Non-Clustered Index - logical orders do not match the physical state on the disk
  ## Three Layers of Data Abstraction - 
  ## A. View (user view) - What the user sees
  ## B. Logical - the way the information is stored oredered and link
  ## C. Physical - Physical storage : the disk or device and hardware
  
  ## SQL PROGRAMMING
  ## SELECT - extracts data from a database.
  SELECT membership type FROM allmembers
  SELECT DISTINCT membership type FROM allmembers - only shows unique data from these columns
  ## UPDATE - updates data in a database.
  UPDATE allmembers // SET column1 = membership type
  ## DELETE - deletes data from a database.
  DELETE FROM allmembers // WHERE membershiptype = "12month"
  ## INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database.
  INSERT INTO allmembers // 
  ## CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database.
  ## ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database.
  ## CREATE TABLE - creates a new table.
  ## FROM - select table
  ## WHERE - a clause used to filter data
  ## AND, NOR, NOT- conditions used with where to filter
  ## ORDER BY - used to sort 
  ## INSERT INTO - used to add records to a table or values to i
  ## VALUES - When inserting, deleting, and updating, use this to add values
  ## ISNULL, ISNOTNULL - (does not mean number 0) - to check if there is no value present
  ## SELECT TOP - filter records by value or by percentage
  SELECT TOP 25 (or) SELECT TOP 10%
  ## MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, COUNT - same function as excel but just select column
  SELECT MIN membershiptype
  ## LIKE - used with where to find a similarity between records
  ## WILDCARD - used to find a certain similarity between records - used to substitute for another string
  ## IN - (multiple OR arguments) specify values 
  ## BETWEEN - specify a range of values
  ## JOIN - clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them
  ## (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
  ## LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
  ## RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
  ## FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
